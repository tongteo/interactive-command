## 📍 Overview

The Interactive Command repository hosts an integrated web application with a Python-Flask backend responsible for handling external API calls, and a frontend built utilizing React. The application takes user input and sends it to an external endpoint, before returning the response to the user. It uses Jest for backend testing and React libraries for front-end functionality. Key features include comprehensive error handling, performance metric tracking, compatibility across browsers, and rich CSS styling for enhanced user experience.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The system uses a structured Frontend-Backend Architecture, with the front-end written in JavaScript (React) and back-end in Python (Flask).|
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The code doesn't appear to include descriptive inline comments or a readable README, affecting understandability and usability for new developers. |
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The system depends on external libraries such as React, Flask, and testing libraries. These are managed through package.json and requirements.txt files.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The codebase is modular, with a separation between front-end and back-end code, and further division based on functionality within the React components.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | Jest is used as the testing framework, with initial unit tests in place. However, comprehensive testing for all components and functionality is lacking. |
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | The system uses web-vitals library for analyzing performance, a good practice. However, optimizations are not explicitly seen. |
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The codebase doesn't seem to contain explicit security measures. However, CORS is enabled on the backend server to avoid cross-origin issues. |
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| Git is being used for version control as evident by the .gitignore file. However, there's no clear evidence of branches or feature-focused development.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The front-end interacts with the backend server via API calls. Also, the backend server forwards requests to an external endpoint. |
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | The system's ability to scale isn't clear, as it lacks elements like load balancing or microservice architecture that would allow distributed processing. |
